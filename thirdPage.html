			I am a junior at Queens College. The major I am taking is design. I want to explore more about art and graphic design. I am looking forward to become a better designer and to have more experience on graphic design. I have done some work on animation, graphic design, game design. I love design very much and I work hard on it. I hope I can have a good opportunity to continue to develop in this profession and to wish the design I made could make other people like it.
